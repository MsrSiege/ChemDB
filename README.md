# ChemDB: SDB Query Tool
**SDB Query Tool** is a GUI-based tool to automate the collection of chemical data, including labour security-related information, and to provide substance data sheets. 

### üìñ Background and Motivation
With the introduction of the REACH regulation (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals) at the latest, practical users of chemicals have access to a wealth of information about the chemical itself, as well as its use from the perspective of labour safety.

To the best of my knowledge, there is currently no officially by European authorities provided, automated method to easily obtain chemical data and labour safety-related information when handling these chemicals. The SDB Query Tool aims to fill this gap until an official user-friendly alternative is offered by authoritative sources.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Attention
**SDB Query Tool** is currently in Beta. Be also aware that this project is my first in many regards: in Python, in using GitHub, in publishing software. If you choose to use it, be prepared for potential bugs. It would help me a lot if you report bugs, propose changes to the code you find helpful and contribute to the project in any other way.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
I've developed this tool for MS Windows and will provide a precompiled version for MS Windows to run as-is. I didn't test the tool on other platforms.

If you are familiar with GitHub feel free to clone the repostitory and use your IDE of choice.

## üëã Usage
I've developed this tool to be GUI-based. Currently, I don't plan add command line support.
